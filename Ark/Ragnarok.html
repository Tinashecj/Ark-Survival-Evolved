							<h2>Ragnarok</h2>
							<p class="author"></p>
						</header>
						<div class="articlebody">
							<p><strong>Ragnarok is a free, official, non-canonical DLC expansion map for ARK: Survival Evolved. Ragnarok was released on June 12, 2017 for the PC, Mac and Linux version of ARK, and for consoles on August 29, 2017. Half of the map was finished at PC release date and 75% at console's release. The map was declared 99% finished for PC in December 2017 and consoles in January 2018.</strong></p>
							<h3>Creatures</h3>
							<p><strong>Ragnarok adds several new creatures, such as the Ice Wyvern, Iceworm Male, Dire Polar Bear, and Griffin, as well as 2 new dungeon bosses: the Iceworm Queen and the Lava Elemental. It's a whole new map that boasts an expansive 144 sq. kilometer environment, an active volcano, species from DLC Scorched Earth, and higher than average spawn rates of Megalania and Ovis (creatures that are harder to find on other maps). The map is 99% complete. Chunks of the map will be incrementally released in later patches. On Ragnarok there are unique Beaver Dams; they are bigger and look more like beaver dams in real life. Beavers can live in the Dams, too. Creatures tamed and items received on Official Ragnarok servers can be brought to the vanilla map The Island, except Polar Bears.</strong></p>
							<h3>Size</h3>
							<p><strong>Ragnarok is approximately 2.5x the size of The Island, in terms of land mass, and roughly 4x in total size. These calculations do not account for the significant, wide-ranging cave networks, and sizable dungeons.</strong></p>

							<h2><strong>Biomes</strong></h2>
							<p class="author"></p>
						</header>
						<div class="articlebody">
							<h3>Light Jungle</h3>	
							<p><strong>The Light Jungle is currently the biggest playable biome. It feature most of the creatures, ressources and caves currently available on Ragnarok. It also holds an Dungeon.</strong></p>
							<h3>Icy Mountain Tops</h3>
							<p><strong>The Icy Mountain Tops are a ressourcefull but also very dangerous place. ItÂ´s home of the terrifing Icewyvern and offer an unique new Dungeon. There is also a glacier like cave which holds one of the entrances to the Icedungeon.</strong></p>
							<h3>Flatlands</h3>
							<p><strong>The flatlands are a partly done currently developed area. Its mostly flat so its great for building huge bases on flat ground. It also offers a tiny swamp and a castle. in the underground will be a huge cave.</strong></p>
							<h3>Flatlands Swamp</h3>
							<p><strong>The Flatlands Swamp is a very tiny swamp area located around a castle. Its the first of many swamp areas and also a teaser for the actual swamp biome.</strong></p>
							<h3>Rock Valley</h3>	
							<p><strong>This biome is a tiny little valley with some pines and two lakes. These lakes are home for Beavers and their dams. You can also find two tiny waterfalls with hidden caves behind which over a nice little base spot.</strong></p>
							<h3>Swamps</h3>
							<p><strong>The swamps are centered in the south and east in the Writhing Swamps and are home to the Plant Species X, Meganeura, Beelzebufo, Sarcosuchus, and Titanoboa. The swamps are a dangerous place due to both the heat and its inhabitants, but the dangers lead to greater rewards, including Rare Mushroom, Rare Flower, Plant Species X Seed, and plentiful resources. However, there is little if any Metal, Crystal, and Obsidian.</strong></p>
							<h3>Redwood Forest</h3>
							<p><strong>The redwood forest is centered on the heart of the main island around Deep Island and Red Peak, south of the Volcano and directly north of the swamps.</strong></p>
							<h3>Rivers</h3>	
							<p><strong>The rivers are home to the Piranha, Oncorhynchus, Coelacanth, Sarcosuchus, and Spinosaurus. The rivers are a great source of Stone, Flint, and some Metal.</strong></p>
							<h3>Oceans</h3>
							<p><strong>The ocean is an area that is thought to contain some worthwhile stuff. The only discouragement is the fact that there are dangerous creatures such as the Electrophorus, Angler, Megalodon, Dunkleosteus, Liopleurodon, Plesiosaur, and Mosasaurus, though most other creatures such as the Trilobite, Coelacanth, Ichthyosaurus, and Leedsichthys are far less dangerous. Other than that, it'd be a great spot for a vacation! The Spinosaurus is a great substitute for the Megalodon if you want to do some oceanic exploration.</strong></p>
							<h3>Caves</h3>	
							<p><strong>The caves are the only other place besides the mountains and snow where Metal, Crystal, and Obsidian are found in abundance, but are usually filled to the brim with the Pulmonoscorpius, Titanoboa, Araneomorphus, Onychonycteris, Dung Beetle, and Megalania. You may also find "care packages" and some of the items required to summon the world bosses deep within each cavern. The Underground World is located under the Jungles and accessed through a cave entrance and three underwater passages.</strong></p>
