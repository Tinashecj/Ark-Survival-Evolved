							<h2>Homestead Update</h2>
							</div>
							
						</header>
						<div class="articlebody">
							<h3><strong>March 5, 2019</strong></h3>
							<p><strong>Today, Studio Wildcard released its highly anticipated Homestead update for the dinosaur survival action-adventure ARK: Survival Evolved! Homestead is a free update to ARK that improves existing structures, adds many new customizable building pieces with increased placement options, as well as updates the Kibble system for simplifying creature taming! This update is now available to all ARK players on Steam PC, Xbox One and PlayStation4.</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Homestead includes the major elements of Structures Plus (S+), a player created Sponsored Mod by Orionsun. Studio Wildcard ran a public beta for the Homestead update, testing the features with the community, and all of the builds you see featured in the video trailer below were made by survivors! Be sure to check out their videos on how to build these incredible structures yourself.</strong></p>
							<iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VdXku3-sxi4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p><strong>ARK players love to create amazing structures with the vast open-world, showing off their creativity and imagination with amazing results! Now with Homestead, the customization potential has escalated with new choices for existing structures and their placement options, as well as a myriad of additional pieces to utilize in any way your imagination can conjure. Existing buildings were preserved while all new snap points, alternate versions of structure pieces and entirely new structure pieces, were added. Triangle floors, half walls, angled pieces and much more provide survivors the ability to create stairs, ramps, triangular buildings, reworked pipes and cables, etc. These new tools let every building look as unique as its builder!</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Homestead delivers a simplified Kibble system across all ARK content. Each creature now falls into one of six categories, and that creature's egg can be used to tame any creature within that category. Instead of 50+ different kibbles all requiring a specific egg, its reduced to: Basic, Simple, Regular, Superior, Exception, and Extraordinary Kibbles.</strong></p>

							<h2>Modding Contest</h2>

						<div class="articlebody">
							<h3><strong>May 10, 2019</strong></h3>
							<p><strong>Last year we held a great modding contest where 61 mod authors competed for a grand prize of $15,000. Valguero, Automated ARK, Gunsmoke County, and Primal Fear took home some serious cash prizes. We're happy to announce that after spending some time working on the process and system for managing the contests, that they will be returning on May 31st!</strong></p>
							<p><strong>This time around we'll be splitting the contest into two categories for mods and maps. Each category will be judged separately and have its own prize pool. We'll have more information for you about the contest in the coming month but we wanted to give everyone some time to decide on which category they wish to enter and get cracking on projects.</strong></p>

							<h2>Eggcellent Adventure</h2>
							</div>
							
						</header>
						<div class="articlebody">
							<h3><strong>April 15, 2019</strong></h3>
							<p><strong>Beginning tomorrow, Tuesday April 16th until April 30th, survivors will be able to experience our annual Eggcellent Adventure event on PC, Xbox, and PS4! During Eggcellent Adventure, survivors will be able to collect special "Bunny Eggs" across the ARK from wild Bunny Dodo's. These Bunny Eggs can paint or used in special Cooking Pot recipes to craft new holiday-themed item skins the Marshmallow Dodo Hat and Chocolate Bunny Club, as well as returning skins: Bunny Ears, a Bunny Costume for the Procoptodon, Knitted Chick Hat, and Egg Shell Hat!</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bunny Oviraptor's will also drop festive Dino Candy this year. Collect the candy and feed it to your tames for a special festive effect! To top it all off, wild creatures roaming the ARKs will also find themselves feeling eggcellent, sporting bright colours of Green, Magenta, Yellow, and Blue!</strong></p>
							<p><strong>After you've managed to hunt down a Bunny Dodo  and find yourself an egg, place the egg down on the ground and take out your paint brush and dyes. You'll be able to paint select regions on the egg as well as free-hand paint it with the brush to paint any design on it. Be creative!</strong></p>
