							<h3><img src="images/Background/thumbsUp.png" alt="Thumbs Up"> dgarner5005 Posted: 17 Aug, 2015 @ 2:29am</h3>
							<p><strong>This is a review of the offline game.</strong></p>
		
							<p><strong>This game has been one of the best games I have ever played. I have been playing games for over 25 years and haven't experienced a game this epic. I'd like to share one of my quests.</strong></p>
							
							<p><strong>I had just finished my first base on a peninsula. It had a bed and some storage containers and was starting to feel pretty safe. I hadn't seen many dangerous Dino other that dilos (the ones that killed the fat guy in Jurassic park). I had stockpiled some goods and decided I would go try to tame something worth taming. </strong></p>
							
							<p><strong>I found a raptor in a valley surrounded by rocks and decided he was gonna be my buddy. The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe. I saddled him up and decided to give him a go. He was amazing, we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me. </strong></p>
							
							<p><strong>After I respawned back at my base I was in panic mode and jumped on my only other ride able Dino which was a Parasaur and hauled♥♥♥♥♥back to where my raptor was. We never made it. About halfway there we were attacked by a pack of raptors and both were killed. My next re-spawn was kinda bleak from the start. I re-spawn in a random location that I thought would be near my Dino. After what seemed like hours of carefully navigating my map back to where i though my Dino was I started to freeze and starve. I would move thirty to fifty feet and whistle then repeat. The sun went down and my hopes for recovering my dino with it. Just as I had given up hope I was surrounded by scorpions and I thought "oh well". A second later my Raptor jumped down from the rocky ledges above and killed one of the scorpions. I frantically jumped on his back and ran from the other scorpions. My health was still falling due to the cold and me starving. Once we got to relative safety I hopped off his back and checked his inventory. Somehow he had collected a full suit of armor and plenty of berries whilst we were hunting earlier. We eventually dodged meat eaters and found our way home once the sun rose. </strong></p>
							
							<p><strong>I have never felt that since of disparity and relief from a video game before. It sounds funny but it really felt like the raptor saved my life. I've never got that into a game before. That one experience was worth more than what I paid for the game.</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Alright, I haven't really played ARK on steam because all of my friends are on Xbox so that is where I play. But this is the best place to leave a review though.</strong></p>
		
							<p><strong>I have logged 39 days 13 hours and 45 minutes (Almost 950 hours) on Xbox under my JumpiestPizza7 account, so I know the ins and outs on ARK. I got the game for like 25 or 30 bucks the Saturday after it came out on Xbox back in December 2015, and man it was totally worth it. It's a shame that the game has so many bugs that the bugs are the sole reason a great many people don't like the game because it really does undermine what I believe ARK is about, the multiplayer experience. ARK has the best community of players I have ever seen in my life. The community makes this game so good. My friends and I have been peasants on the beach to the alpha tribe of some really fun servers, and that's what makes it. I have been in countless wars, not that offline raiding bull crap, but actual Game of Thrones type wars where there are multiple sides and you start pumping out gunpowder like crazy for bullets and then duke it out like men on the beach for territory. Those times I had with my friends and absolute strangers were some of the best times I have had as a gamer. Some of my enemies ended up becoming my best allies. We have had dinosaurs who we were so attached to man, and still talk about how cool the dinos were and what they had done that made them so amazing. (Like Tyrone the dodo who got the last hit and killed a carno who was attacking our base on an official server) The game is so addictive and has such a great community of players. The game isn't for everyone though. It is very time consuming if you want to progress far, especially on official servers. A lot of people who have work and school simply don't have enough time during the weekdays to put in the effort it takes to not get raided, and I understand that. Also it is very difficult to progress without multiple people. (Ex. While taming a level 120 Argentavis, your friend can be grinding metal) So I do not recommend this game to everyone, it takes a certain type of person to enjoy ARK, like I said it's time consuming. If you do have the time, friends, heart, and bravery you should give it a shot. I don't look at my 39 days on this game as wasted time, but over a month of my life of good times, laughter, and quality time spent with my friends. Thank you Studio Wildcard for making my favorite game and doing your best to improve it with dlc and updates. Though you can't fix all the bugs, ARK has come a long way and improved drastically since 2015. I appreciate all the efforts of anyone who worked on this amazing game because without you, I wouldn't have all those good memories. No one will probably ever read this review but Wildcard deserves some praise, so thank you.</strong></p>
							
							<p><strong>TLDR; 11/10 would definitely recommend if you have the time.</strong></p>

							<h3><img src="images/Background/thumbsUp.png" alt="Thumbs Up"> playingdead Posted: 18 Apr @ 10:51pm</h3>
							<p><strong>After over 5000 hours in this game, I feel it's finally fair that I leave a review.</strong></p>
		
							<p><strong>I initially bought ark in early development when it was cheap, but if I knew what the game would be like today, I would have paid $60 for it as well. $60 for 5000+ hours of enjoyment is definitely worth it's value. Now.. that being said, on to my actual review.</strong></p>
							
							<p><strong>I like PvP and I like PvE, but if you want to get the most out of this game, I recommend playing on PvE. There is SO much to explore and enjoy in this game, but if you're playing just to PvP I feel like it will really limit your overall experience and perception of the game.</strong></p>
							
							<p><strong>While ARK itself is a great game, I'd like to take a moment to appreciate the mod-makers who have really been the backbone of this game and helping it live to it's full potential. If you are planning on buying this game, I highly reccomend you looking into the mods Structures Plus, Eco's RP and Decor, and Castles, Keeps, and Forts.</strong></p>
							
							<p><strong>The amount of fun I've had in this game far outweighs the bad, and I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting to play a survival game more casually.</strong></p>
